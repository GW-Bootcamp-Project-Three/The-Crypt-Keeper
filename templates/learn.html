                          Cryptocurrency is a new form of digital money! According to CoinMarketCap.com, there are more than 6,700 cryptocurrencies available! Although cryptocurrency is not 
                          widely accepted as a regular form of payment, it is commonly used as an alternative to stocks and bonds.
                          Many companies have issued their own utility tokens, which is simply another form of currency, that may traded for the good or service provided by
                          the company itself. However, in order to access this good or service, one will need to exchange real currency for these tokens, which are recorded in a blockchain.</br>

                          A blockchain is basically an open and secure ledger that holds real-time transactions. This serves the function as a typical bank or credit card company so that
                          anyone may review and verify transactions. The primary purpose of this technology is to enable secure payments without a third party service. Additionally, in certain instances, it does not
                          require sensitive information, which makes the user more protected and secure during any domestic or international exchanges. More information may also be found at <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-blockchain">Coinbase</a>.</br>

                            Bitcoin (BTC) was created to function as peer-to-peer electronic cash. Whether you are spending or accepting BTC as payment it is prudent to understand how a transaction works. Bitcoin transactions are essentially messages, similar to email, which are digitally signed using cryptography and sent to the entire Bitcoin Network for verification. Transactions are public and can be found on the digital ledger known as the blockchain. Source: Bitcoin

                       2) Next, obtain a "wallet" to hold your currency! There are three types of wallets you may choose: Online, Software, and Hardware.

                          Bitcoin is one of the most popular and well-known cryptocurrencies. It is not managed by a bank or other third-party service and all transactions 
                          are recorded in the blockchain network, therefore, eliminating the risk of double-spending bitcoins.

                          - The price of bitcoin is unpredictable and a high-risk asset</br>
                          - Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed and should be considered carefully</br>
                          - Although user identity is private, transactions are not anonymous as they are stored publicly</br>
                          - Bitcoin is applicable to income, sales, payroll, and capital gains taxes; it is important to verify regulations with your</br> local and federal government.

                              As with any type of investment, it is crucial to be aware of legal implications. For example, for US residents, the IRS 
                              has defined cryptocurrencies as property which means that it is subjected to the capital gains tax. Foreign exchanges may also add another layer 
                              of precedence to tax matters as well as the overall reporting of profits and losses. Additionally, since cryptocurrencies are independent from central banks or governments, there is a separate process when it comes to fraud. It is highly likely that if a 
                              cryptocurrency exchange is hacked, there is no standard practice to recover the missing funds as one would with a typical case. The crypt-keepers always recommend to do thorough research and discuss these items with your tax professionals to stay ahead of the curve.

                                  There are many reasons why cryptocurrency is growing in popularity!</br>
                                  1) Central banks are not involved, unlike the US Dollar or the Euro; hence, there is a higher chance for the value to remain stable</br>
                                  2) There is a higher level of security through the use of blockchain compared to traditional payment methods</br>
                                  3) Low cost money transfers - there are little to no fees</br>
                                  4) Higher chance of profit</br>
                                  5) Simple investment process</br>
                                  6) Easier foreign transactions - reduces the risk of carrying cash during travels and eliminates exchange/transaction fees</br>
